1
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included).  The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
//solution
func ex001(low int,high int)string{
	var result []string

	for i := low; i <= high; i++ {
		if(i%7==0&&i%5!=0){
			result = append(result, strconv.Itoa(i))
		}
	}


	return strings.Join(result,",")
}
2
Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers. The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8
Then, the output should be: 40320
solution

func computeFact(given int)(uint64,error){
	var result  uint64= 1

	if(given<=0){
		return 0,fmt.Errorf("Error")
	}

	if given==1{
		return 1,nil
	}
	for i := 1; i <=given; i++ {
		result*=uint64(i)
	}

	return result,nil
}
